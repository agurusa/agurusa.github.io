**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that padding is the area around the content, and the margin is the area around the outside of the element. The border is the area between the padding and the margin. When I was writing the code for my homepage, I really had no idea what I was doing and why changing the padding and margin seemed to do similar things for some elements, and unexpected things for others. By the time I was styling my blog page, I realized that I was using padding and margins inconsistently. Once I really knew what they did and how to position elements without simply changing the margin, it started making more sense.
**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that fixed and absolute positioning pulls the element outside of the normal flow. It made it difficult to position elements when my navigation menu was fixed. When I wasn't sure how to use relative positioning, I had to change the top margin to move passed the navigation menu.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The easiest to implement was the color changes. The most difficult has been the hover transitions. I still haven't really figured it out, and I can't quite get rid of the effects for mobile formatting.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned a lot! I learned that it's important to keep your code clean and understand why some elements inherit formatting. I still have some trouble figuring that out, so DevTools has been really helpful for me.
